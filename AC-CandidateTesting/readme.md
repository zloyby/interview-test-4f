# Ataccama - Java test

## Database browser
See ./todo/ folder for initial requirements for this task.

I've spent about 30-32 hours for this project (from a business point of view - 4 full working days of employee).
I hope this time is enough to understand developer skills. Imho even 24 hours should be enough.

### Tasks
