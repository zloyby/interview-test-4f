# Test projects
My collection of test projects from different companies. You can analyse my knowledge and expose it to the real job experience. Tried not to spend more than 24 hours (~3 working days), because I think it's enough to understand developer skills.

## AC
Nice task to develop web based database browser (similar to desktop application DBeaver) from scratch. See "./todo/Java Developer - REST API for database.pdf" file for initial requirements.

_Keywords: Java, Spring, Hibernate, REST API (jackson, swagger), Databases (h2, mysql, postgresql)_

## HR
Modification of an original project (from "/todo/HR-CandidateTesting.tar.gz") to make it runnable locally (fixed packages, dependency problems and so on). Implementation of 5 additional features.

_Keywords: Java, Spring, Hibernate, CSV parser, Database migration, Servlet filters and IP limitations_

## CE
Very short task for 2 hours. Just setup environment, run application and then implementation of 3 new features. As usual, original project is in /todo/ folder. 

_Keywords: Java, ElasticSearch, Sorting, Bayesian Rating_

## IF
Just needed to pass behavioral test, no development.
