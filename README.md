# Test projects
My collection of test projects from different companies. You can analize my knowledge and expose to the real job experience. In most cases I've tried to do projects in 24 hours maximum (~3 working days), because I think this time is enough to understand developer skills.

## AC
Nice task to develop web based database browser (similar to desktop application DBeaver) from scrach. See "./todo/Java Developer - REST API for database.pdf" file for initial requirements.

_Keywords: Java, Spring, Hibernate, REST API (jackson, swagger), Databases (h2, mysql, postgresql)_

## HR
Have to modify original project (from "/todo/HR-CandidateTesting.tar.gz") and make it runnable locally, fix possible dependency problems and so on. Then implement 5 issues.

_Keywords: Java, Spring, Hibernate, CSV parser, Database migration, Servlet filters and IP limitations_

## CE
Very short task for 2 hours. Just setup environment, run application and then implement 3 issues. As usual, original project is in /todo/ folder. 

_Keywords: Java, ElasticSearch, Sorting, Bayesian Rating_

## IF
Just have to pass behavioral test, no develop.
